##Build   
After cloning this repository, run ```npm install``` in the root directory to install the dependencies. As soon as all of them are installed, you will have to run ```webpack``` to bundle all the scripts and styles correctly for use.   

You can then load the extension into chrome by using the developer feature, "Load unpacked extension".
